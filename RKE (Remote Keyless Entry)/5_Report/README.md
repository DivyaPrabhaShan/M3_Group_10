# 1.Remote Keyless Entry
 # 1.1 Problem Statement
  * Remote keyless Entry system is used for easy controlling of vehicle and for security reasons. The previous systems of keys had many problems with security and lack of features. This system has sorted out the problems of previous systems and has many features.
  # 1.2 Description
  * The project Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) system is designed to remotely lock, unlock  and to access the vehicle. It consists of two major working components i.e. Transmitter and receiver. This system is third generations of keys, the first gen was  physical keys to access the vehicle and the second gen is keyless entry which uses  similar components but with less features and lower security level. The RKE allows the key holders to remotely lock and unlock car doors, turn on and off alarms and  can access few other features.
